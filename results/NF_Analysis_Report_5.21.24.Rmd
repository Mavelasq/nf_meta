# Summary

A meta analysis was conducted testing the influence of different neurofeedback (NF) training parameters on changes in neural activity from (1) first NF training session to last training session (k = 35) and (2) pre-training baseline to post-training rest (k = 20). Analyses were conducted on the following predictors: training duration, presence of pretraining rehearsal, imaging device, quality assessment score, presence of additional training instruction, blinding, functinal localizer, year and age. Predictors with too few cases per level (<10) were excluded from the analysis. 

## Methods

- **Convert SE to SD**: All pre and post variability measures were converted to standard deviation in order to calculate the standardized mean difference (SMD)
- The **standardized mean difference (SMD)** was calculated using Hedge's g, as this is appropriate for studies with small sample sizes (Mean N = 16.23, SD = 12.67) (Hedge, 1981). This was done separately for last vs. first training session and post-training vs. baseline.
- **Adjust for Direction of Effect**: In studies where the task was to decrease activity, the SMD was multiplied by -1 to ensure that a positive SMD indicates a change in the predicted direction.
- **Pooled effect size**: Random effects model was used to calculate the pooled effect size. The Restricted Maximum Likelihood (REML) method was used for estimating the between-study variance (tau²). REML was used since it produces results with reduced bias (Veroniki et al., 2016). The R package meta was used to calculate the pooled effect sizes (Balduzzi, 2019). 
- **Outlier detection**: Graphic Display of Heterogeneity (GOSH) plot analysis (Olkin, 2012) was performed in order to identify influential cases which had a significant contrbution to heterogeneity. 

### Meta-regression and Sub-Group Analyses:
- **Check for Multicollinearity**: Correlations between predictor variables were assessed to check for multicollinearity. Variables with correlations ≥ 0.8 were considered for removal. No significant multicollinearity was detected.
- **Multi-model inference**: was used to identify the best-fitting model and the most influential predictors (Harrer et al., 2009).
- **Meta-Regression Analysis**: Meta-regression was performed to investigate the effect of potential moderators on the effect sizes.
- The following **sub-group analyses** were performed: Blinding, Imaging Device, instruction provided, pre-trainng rehearsal present, functional localizer, continuous or intermittent training. 

## Results
- When testing the overall difference between the first and last training sessions there was a significant effect of training (*g* = 0.34, *t* = 6.31, *p* < 0.001). 
- There was no significant effect when testing the difference between pre-training baseline and post-training activity (*g* = 0.1999, *t* = 2.05, *p* = 0.0557). 
- The effect size for studies that used EEG was significantly higher (g = .40) than those that used fMRI (g = .19) (p = .01)
- The effect size for studies that included a pre-training rehearsal trial was significantly lower (g = 0.20) than those that did not include one (g = 0.40) (p = .04)
- Although multimodel inference analysis classified training duration as the most important predictor, there was no significant relationship between standardized mean differences and training duration($I^2$ = 71.51%, $R^2$ = .77%, $F_((1,32)$ ) = 3.32, *p* = 0.078)

## Next Steps and Questions
- Go back to the papers that reported more than one type of feedback and maybe try to find a way to further aggregate studies or reduce categories.
- Regions of interest might need to be aggregated into categories. Discuss with group on how to do this.
- Need to make a comparison between different targeted frequency bands. Some frequency bands have too few studies and might need to be excluded. Another option is to treat frequency as a continous variable. 
- Plot risk of bias
- How can we include data from multiple sessions? One option could be to run a regression between SMD and time since first session with amount of training up to that point as a covariate. Open to suggestions.
- How do we apply correction for multiple comparisons here? 
- Need to clean methods and results for the manuscript. Also not sure what are all the values that need to be included with each result.
